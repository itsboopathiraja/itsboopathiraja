<h4 align="left">2024 - Recently Completed Project on - GovCompass:Guiding Citizens to Services</h4>
<p align="left"> In 2024, I spearheaded a minor project at Sri Shanmugha College of Engineering and Technology, leading to the creation of GovCompass. This web-based platform, powered by Python, revolutionizes the way citizens voice their concerns about public issues by ensuring these concerns reach the right government officials.

As the team leader, I was instrumental in developing a system that acts as a bridge between citizens and the government. This system simplifies the resolution of public issues by directing them to the appropriate authorities. A standout feature of GovCompass is its ability to provide real-time updates to users about the status of their complaints, promoting transparency and enhancing user satisfaction.

I also led the design and implementation of a user-friendly admin interface. This interface allows admins to manage complaints, update their status, and interact directly with users, fostering effective communication. Under my leadership, we prioritized data security, implementing measures such as password hashing, user data encryption, and safeguards against SQL injection attacks.

My leadership was pivotal to the successful completion of this project. GovCompass stands as a testament to our team’s commitment to providing a reliable and efficient tool for citizens and government officials, making the process of voicing and resolving public issues seamless and efficient </p>


<h4 align="left">2023 - Completed Project on - Innovative Data Management in Education: A Telegram bot Approach</h4>
<p align="left">This project presents a Telegram bot, powered by Python, that is set to change the landscape of data management in educational settings. The bot is engineered to compile a comprehensive database of student information, ranging from basic identifiers to more complex data, thereby eliminating the need for educators to manually collect this information.

Traditionally, educators would circulate an Excel sheet for students to populate with their details. This method, however, is time-consuming as it requires educators to manually search for a specific student’s details. Our bot offers a more efficient solution. It not only gathers the data but also organizes it into a structured Excel sheet.

Imagine a scenario where a faculty member needs specific information about a student (like fee details, parents’ contact number, or Aadhaar number) from a pool of a thousand students. They simply input the student’s register number into the bot. The bot then sifts through the entire dataset and retrieves the complete student profile in a matter of seconds. This greatly reduces the time spent on data retrieval, thereby improving efficiency.

The bot also incorporates administrative features, allowing admins to post updates or announcements, delete them when necessary, and manage admin roles. These announcements are visible to both students and faculty, ensuring effective communication within the institution.

The main aim of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for educators to effortlessly and securely manage student information.</p>
